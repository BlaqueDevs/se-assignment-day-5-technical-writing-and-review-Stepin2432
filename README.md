If H2 headings are bold and 16pt, maintain this format for all H2s throughout the document.
•	Implement Hierarchical Structure
o	Organize Logically: Use headings and subheadings to establish a clear hierarchy.
o	Heading Levels: Avoid skipping levels (e.g., do not jump from H1 to H3).
o	Example:
H1: "User Guide"
H2: "Setting Up Your Account"
H3: "Creating a Password"
H3: "Enabling Two-Factor Authentication"
•	Keep Headings Brief
o	Aim for Brevity: Ideally, headings should consist of 3-8 words.
o	Avoid Wordiness: Focus on the core message without unnecessary filler.

❌ "Here Is How to Make an Appointment with a Doctor"
✅ "Booking an Appointment"
•	Incorporate Relevant Keywords
o	Improve Searchability: Utilize keywords that pertain to the content and aid in SEO for digital documents.
o	Enhance Navigation: Keywords facilitate finding specific information for readers.
o	Example:
In a document about telemedicine, include terms such as "virtual visit," "patient portal," or "telehealth services" in the headings.
•	Use Action-Oriented Language When Relevant
o	Guide the Reader: This approach is particularly effective for instructions or how-to guides.
o	Start with Verbs: Employ action verbs like "Learn," "Build," "Create," "Manage."
o	Example:
Informational: "Appointment Features"
Action-Oriented: "How to Book an Appointment"
•	Avoid Jargon and Complex Terms
o	Use Plain Language: Unless your audience is highly technical, refrain from specialized terminology.
o	Simplify When Possible: Ensure the heading is clear at a glance.
o	Example:
❌ "Telehealth Asynchronous Communication Protocols"
✅ "How Messaging Works in the App"
•	Highlight Importance and Priority
o	Signal Key Sections: Make important sections noticeable by using bold or larger font sizes.
o	Use Emphasis Strategically: Avoid excessive formatting (e.g., overusing bold or italics can diminish impact).
o	Example:
Main Section: "Getting Started with Telemedicine"
Subsection: "First Steps: Account Setup"
•	Employ Parallel Structure
o	Consistency in Phrasing: If one heading begins with a verb, maintain that structure in others.
o	Improves Flow: Establishes a predictable pattern for the reader.
o	Example:
"Setting Up Your Profile"
"Managing Your Appointments"
"Tracking Your Prescriptions"
•	Test with Your Audience
o	Gather Feedback: Whenever possible, ask a few target readers if the headings make sense and guide them through the document.
o	Refine as Necessary: Be willing to adjust headings that may be confusing or unclear.
o	Example:
If users find it challenging to locate information on payment methods, consider updating the heading to "How to Make a Payment" rather than "Financial Information."
Conclusion:
Effective headings and subheadings assist readers in:
•	Quickly navigating content.
•	Grasping the document's structure.
Easily locating relevant information.
